# TextAdventure
A simple text-based adventure game. Simple attempt at creating a text controlled actions and various mapped consequences. Still in alpha phase.

This game is still under construction but allows creation of game objects and allows various acts to be committed on them.
It has game objects like elves, goblins etc. and allows actions like hit, heal, revive etc.

Just try and figure this stuff out by yourself.
Still a work in progress.
